        <h1>Flaky Pie Crust</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/23-pies_finished.jpg" alt="Two unbaked pies">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe makes enough dough for one 23 cm (9 inch) covered pie. If your pie only requires a bottom crust, use half this recipe. However, for best results, make the full recipe. If only a single crust is required, make the full recipe and freeze half for later.</p>
        <p>In contrast to bread, pie crust and other pastries should be made in a way that minimizes the development of gluten. Once the water has been added, the dough should be worked as little as possible to minimize toughness in the finished crust.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>310 g (2 ½ cups) flour</li>
            <li>6 g (1 tsp) salt</li>
            <li>4 g (1 tsp) sugar (optional)</li>
            <li>225 g (1 cup) cold butter</li>
            <li>95 ml (⅓ cup + 1 tbsp) cold water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour, salt and sugar together in a deep bowl.</li>
            <li>Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry blender or two butter knives, cut the butter into the flour until the butter is in small pea-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Add cold water; cut the water into the flour-butter mixture with the edge of a rubber spatula until it is evenly moistened and will hold together when pressed.</li>
            <li>Form the dough into a ball with your hands, kneading in any loose flour. This should be done as quickly as possible to avoid melting the butter in the dough.</li>
            <li>Chill the dough for 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough evenly in half.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured board, roll each half out until it will cover a 20 cm (9 inch) pie dish, with about 2 cm (¾" inch) overhang.</li>
        </ol>
