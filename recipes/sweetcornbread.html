        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sweet Cornbread is a variant of the Skillet Cornbread made throughout central and eastern Ontario and Quebec and is sometimes known by the alternative name of Johnny Cake. Its presence in these southern regions of Canada is thought to be due to the influx of British Loyalists from what is now the Southern United States moving to the then-English-controlled colonies during the American War of Independence.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>256 mL (1 cup) of cornmeal</li>
            <li>512 mL (2 cups) of flour</li>
            <li>8 mL (1 1/2 teaspoons) of baking powder</li>
            <li>128 mL (1/2 cup) of maple syrup</li>
            <li>128 mL of brown sugar</li>
            <li>128 mL of butter</li>
            <li>5 mL (1 teaspoon) of salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>           
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks as one would for scrambled eggs, then mix in the butter. Soften the butter beforehand if you must by heating it a little.</li>
            <li>The butter/egg mixture should be loose. Add the sugar and maple syrup, mix well, then add the salt to the liquid mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix the cornmeal and baking powder, then blend them into the liquids.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the flour as needed to reach a proper cake batter texture. This should be softer than a cookie dough, able to stick to the mixing spool and come off in blobs. You may not need all of the flour, or may even need a little more based on your eggs and how closely you measured.</li>
            <li>Pour into a greased pan and put into an oven heated to 200°C (400°F) and let bake for between 15-25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
